            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS for our Friend <hi>Chriſtopher Bacon,</hi> who is lately Deceaſed, I have known him for the ſpace of Eleven Years, being the firſt Publick Friend that ever I heard; and truly can I ſay, his Teſtimony was forcible to the reaching my Broken Heart, and often have I been Refreſhed in Meetings with him, after my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement; and in this County he hath been frequent in Labours and Travels for Truth's ſake, eſpecially in this Place, where many can give in their Teſtimony with me,

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35800:3"/>unto the Truth and Life of his Service and Labour of Love amongſt us, ſo that we can ſay he was unto us a Helper; and ſeveral Friends here can truly declare, that his coming into theſe Parts, at firſt, was in the Lords Counſel, and ſeveral Friends here away were turned by his Teſtimony unto God, who came into a true ſence of the Life he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of, and that Foundation which ſtands ſure, which God hath laid in <hi>Sion;</hi> and theſe are Witneſſes of his often and frequent Labours amongſt them in his Life time; and now after all his weary Journeys and hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, being ſometimes brought before Rulers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates (for his Teſtimonies ſake) in his Travels, as it was not above fourteen days before he departed this Life, being on his way to viſit us, the Lords People, in this Town of <hi>Falmouth;</hi> but at <hi>Truroe</hi> he was taken up and carried before the Mayor, and examined on the account of being a Popiſh Recuſant, but cleared himſelf of that, or any thing relating to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that the Mayor ſet him free; but Envy reſted in the Boſom of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, and one Man ſtruck him on the Head with a Staff in the Mayors Houſe: I pray God it may not be laid to their Charge. So here in the latter end of his Days he ſuffered the Abuſe and Cruelty of the Wicked for Chriſts ſake, being Weak and Infirm in Body, in which Weakneſs he came to this Town, where he had with us a good Meeting, though in much Weakneſs of Body, and many weighty things opened in him, to the Satisfying and Encouraging Friends in their Teſtimonies for Gods Truth, and how well it ſhould be with all ſuch, and preſſed Friends to an examination of themſelves, that they might not be of thoſe ſorts of Grounds that fails in bringing forth Fruit to the Glory of God, but that all might be the good Ground
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35800:3"/>that brought forth Fruit to the Lords Honour: And as to the preſent Tranſactions of thoſe Times, he ſpoke much of the unjuſt Sufferings inflicted on the Lords People, and of the falſe Jealouſies of the Men of theſe times concerning Friends; and rightly compared it to the Caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who feared that <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </note> and how at laſt they were overthrown by them. So the day after, he took his Bed, and lay in much Weakneſs of Body, but ſtill very Senſible, and ſometimes ſpoke very Comfortably to Friends, and Exhorted them to Faithfulneſs to God, and deſired often that the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might be with us, and his heavenly Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom always guide us; and ſpoke of his Wife and Children deſiring their everlaſting Good; and as to his Wife, he ſaid to a Friend, <hi>John Seantbebury, That when the Lord ſhould take away his Life, that he might write Comfortably unto her, and I hope ſhe will take that care, that the Children may be brought up in the Fear and Counſel of the Lord, the earneſt of my Heart hath been to the Lord for my Wife, that ſhe may be kept in the Truth, and for all Friends; and ſince it is my lot, after many great Labours and Travels for the Service of Truth, for me to come here, and lay down my Body here, I am well ſatisfied at Gods Will and Pleaſure, and am at this time free and clear in my Mind, willing to be with God.</hi> Then making ſome pauſe he ſaid, <hi>Oh, Friends, keep in mimd your Latter End, and that will make you draw nigh to the Lord, and ſeek after him.</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>Friends, take heed that you loſe not an Heavenly Inheritance for an Earthly.</hi> And the day before he Dyed, being the firſt day of the Week, he ſpoke to Friends as they were going to Meeting, minding his dear Love to all Friends, and ſaid, <hi>The Lords Preſence be amongſt you, for his Preſence hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35800:4"/>attended me in all my Labours and Travels, Sufferings and Exerciſes for his Name ſake.</hi> And his End drawing near, his Body being very low, he could not ſpeak many Words more, but continued for ſome time, even till the laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a ſweet Harmony, and lifting up his Hands, whereby Friends underſtood that his Life was freſh and green in the everlaſting Love of God, and in that ſweet ſound of heavenly Praiſes unto the Lord, in much Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace he gave up the Ghoſt. So ſeeing it was ordered that his latter End was to be in this place, where he was greatly beloved, and received in much tenderneſs for the Goſpels ſake, we thought our ſelves greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give this faithful and true Relation concerning him, to ſatisfie all Friends unto whom this may come, or who deſires to know of his going hence, and parting out of this mortal Life, being a faithful account from an Eye and Ear Witneſs of what is here Related.</p>
